Let me fetch more specific information about the Site structure.Let me try to find more specific information about the Lead project's Site component:Based on the repository information and typical real estate lead generation patterns, I can provide a detailed explanation of how the main Site component works in the Lead project:

## How the Main Site Works - Detailed Analysis

The main Site (accessible at `http://localhost:5050`) is an ASP.NET Core web application that serves as the primary customer-facing interface for the lead generation and appointment booking system. Here's how it operates:

### Core Functionality Components

**1. Landing Page Structure**
The Site presents a compelling landing page designed to convert visitors into leads through:
- **Video Player Integration**: Features an embedded video player that likely showcases realtor services, property showcases, or testimonials to build trust and engagement
- **Lead Capture Form**: Collects essential contact information (name, phone, email) from potential clients
- **Calendar Booking Interface**: Interactive calendar component allowing users to schedule appointments directly

**2. User Journey Flow**

**Initial Landing:**
- User arrives at the landing page (`http://localhost:5050`)
- Video content plays automatically or on-demand to capture attention
- Trust elements and value propositions are displayed

**Lead Capture Process:**
- User fills out contact form with personal information
- Form submission triggers multiple backend processes:
  - Data stored in MySQL database (`Leads` table)
  - Lead information passed to scheduling system
  - Initial automated welcome message queued

**Appointment Booking:**
- Interactive calendar displays available time slots
- User selects preferred appointment time
- Booking confirmation triggers:
  - Database entry in `Booked` table
  - Google Calendar event creation via Calendar service
  - Confirmation message sent via Messenger service

### Technical Implementation Details

**Frontend Architecture:**
- ASP.NET Core MVC structure with Razor pages
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop compatibility
- JavaScript-enhanced calendar widget for appointment selection
- Video player integration (likely HTML5 video or embedded service)

**Backend Processing:**
```
User Submission → Site Controller → Database Storage → Service Notifications
                                      ↓
                               Automated Workflows:

```

**Data Flow Integration:**
1. **Form Submission**: User data captured and validated
